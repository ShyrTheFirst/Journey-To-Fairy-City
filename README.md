Game created for the contest "PyWeek GameJam number 35"

Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the second time I'm making a game for the pyweek game jam (and third time for game jam in general). I'm happy with my progress, but I still need to improve. Many things that I wanted to do I couldn't (mostly because my time was shorter than I expected...) but that's okay, I know now a lot more and I'm ready to keep working in this project for more time!

I tried to do something simple, I needed to feel like I'm doing something in my level and not trying to exceed my knownledgeThis way I now what I can and can't do to study even more those things!! 

I hope everyone that play it, will like it! If not, I'm sorry to disapoint.

How-to-play
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This game is simple: 'E' is the action button, you use it to get the axe, cut the trees and kill the spiders!!The arrows move the character around.

And that's all ... For now!


About the game
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are lost in the middle of the woods... When you lay down to rest you remember a clear path in front of you but now you only see trees everywhere... And it's getting darker and darker as the firepit goes off. You need to do something quickly and get out of there, you don't know what is lurking in the shadows. Try to find your way through the florest, remember who you are and what you were doing there, get your life back or loose it for the darkness.


Thanks!
